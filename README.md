building microdeadlines for your habits and routines

building microdeadlines for day through microhabits for your lifestyle

Each us everyday have blocks in our schedule. We typically don't have a completely, fixed preblocked schedules but we do have blocks throughout their day. We are trying to help you block some time out for new habits. 

Essentially, we are a glorified timer app, that already figures out all the hard work in allocating time towards a habit. In 5 seconds, or less you can go from either building a habit or picking an habit from our store/library, to practicing it. 

The individuals too lazy to set their own timer everytime for habits are the ones who need it the most.

Don't overthink, just do/start (today). 

Microdeadlines for your day, microhabits for your lifestyle.
